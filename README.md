# Population Forecast

This repository provides tools and scripts for population forecasting. It is designed to help users analyze, visualize, and predict population trends using various statistical and machine learning methods.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for population datasets
- Multiple forecasting models (statistical and ML-based)
- Visualization tools for population trends
- Modular code structure for easy customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt))

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chealseainfo1/Population-forecast.git
cd Population-forecast
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Prepare your population dataset (CSV or supported format).
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input data/population_data.csv --output results/forecast.csv
   ```
   Replace the input and output paths as needed.

3. View the results in the `results/` directory.

### Configuration

You can adjust forecasting parameters and model options by editing the configuration in `config.py` or via command-line arguments (if supported).
